Classic forum homepage for NodeBB. Don't like the masonry in lavender or the category boxes of vanilla? How about something a little bit more classical? :)

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-classic-home

## Credits

Inspiration taken from [here](http://demo.myflashlab.com/showcase/TEMPLATE_MOON_LIGHT/HTML_MOON_LIGHT_FORUM_AND_HELPDESK/preview/ForumTemplate/index.html). It's a nice template overall, I wonder if they'd be open to having that entire thing built as a NodeBB theme.
